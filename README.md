As part of the CodTech internship, Task 4 focuses on a crucial aspect of database managementâ€”Database Backup and Recovery. This task aims to provide interns with hands-on experience in securing database data by creating backups and restoring them in case of failure. Interns are required to demonstrate the entire backup and recovery process, ensuring that they understand how to protect important data from loss or corruption. The deliverables for this task include the backup and recovery scripts, along with a well-documented report that explains each step taken during the process.

To complete the task effectively, interns are encouraged to store all related code in a GitHub repository, use proper code commenting for better clarity, and refer to platforms like YouTube, Google, and ChatGPT for guidance. By completing this task, interns will gain valuable skills in data protection, disaster recovery, and real-world database handling, which are vital for any IT professional.
